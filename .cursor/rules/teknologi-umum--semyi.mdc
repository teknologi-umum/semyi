One rule that you need to adhere: Whenever you are unsure about a specific part, do ask of the thing you are confused in. Never give out an answer, even if you are forced to do so.

Refer to [project-milestone.md](mdc:.cursor/docs/project-milestone.md) for guarding on things to be done.

Whenever possible, always put an in-code documentation of your decision that answers "Why a certain things are done this way?"
